**School Portal**

This website was a group project built together with 4 other programming students in the final month of study at wCoding.

Project used PHP and HTML in an MVC structure, with Javascript attached to individual view pages.

The school portal has a three user account system, with admin, teacher and student accounts having different levels of functionality
in the website.

My contributions were:
- Creating diagrams to understand the structure of the website
- Managing the CSS throughout the site to keep it consistent
- Managing Git and Github, focussing on avoiding errors and ensuring CSS consistency during merges
- Completed a course list page where I created a database table, added functions to the controller and model with PHP, and built a course view.
- Building the create/edit/delete post page, adding functions to the controller and model and manipulating the DOM and database via Javascript
- Adding an image uploader to the user profile page
